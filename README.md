# MAVI

It is very  hard  for  visually  impaired  people  to  measure  a  specific  quantity  of  a  liquid.   The  inability of visually impaired people to use such a kitchen gadget increases the struggle to cope independently, while kitchen gadgets designed for visually impaired people increase their confidence and independence. This resulted in the development of MAVI: the Measuring Assistant for the Visually Impaired, which is a measuring cup usable by visually impaired people.

The Final Paper written for the course 4WBB0 - Engineering design can be found in the _Final report.pdf_. The code used by the Arduino can be found in _MAVI.ino_.
